  <p1><p1 id= "myP"> When you click   	<a href="#" onClick= "makeOrange()" > Click here to change list items orange</a> This Link</a>, list items with a class of
  "list-item" should turn orange. When you click   	<a href="#" onClick= "returnToBlack()"> Click me to make them Black again</a>, they should return to whatever color they would be otherwise (this might change if
  you click on those items). This should override whether they are purple or
  not.</p1>

  <p2><p2 id= "myP2"> When you click <a href="#" onClick= "makeHidden(myP);">This link</a>, the above paragraph should
  disappear. When you click <a href="#" onClick= "makeVisible(myP)">This link</a>, it should reappear.</p2>


  
  <p>When you click <a href="#" onClick= "makeBackgroundBlue(myP2);" >this link</a>, the above paragraph should gain a
  blue blackground. When you click that link again, it should become orange.
  When you click it yet another time, it should go back to having a white
  background.</p>
  
  <p>When you click <a href="#">this link</a>, the word "Week" in the title
  (defined in the head) and in the h1 should both become "Eon". When you click
  the h1, both the h1 and the title should go back to saying "Week" (instead of
  "Eon").</p>

  <p>When you click on this paragraph, the above paragraph should go from being
  left-justified to right-justified.</p>

  <p>Clicking <a href="#">this link</a> changes the link's text to say "THIS
  LINK!!" and makes a picture appear below this paragraph. Clicking the picture
  returns the link text to what it was before and makes the picture
  disappear.</p>
  
  <!-- the picture below should start as invisible and only appear when
  something happens in the above paragraph -->
  <img src="http://placekitten.com/g/400/300">

  <p>Clicking this paragraph prompts the user for a word or phrase, then changes
  the text of this paragraph to be that word or phrase</p>
